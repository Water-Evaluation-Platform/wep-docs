The farm profile also lets users configure other water sources, such as bore supply, that are combined with dam water to meet overall water demand. The farm profile can be used to describe a range of on-farm and off-farm non-potable water requirements. In certain circumstances, it is thus possible to configure farm profiles such that the WEP platform can be used to simulate the performance of dams off-farm, such as town dams providing irrigation water for public green spaces.
