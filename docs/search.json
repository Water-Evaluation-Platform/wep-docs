    "text": "The WaterSmart Dams project is a collaborative initiative to improve the resilience and performance of farm dams in Western Australia. Detailed findings from the Water Smart Dams projects can be found in the following technical reports:\nWSD Evaporation Technical Report\nThis technical report investigates the extent and drivers of water losses from farm dams in Western Australia (WA), with a specific focus on evaporation and leakage. Using high-resolution simulations from the General Lake Model (GLM), the study benchmarks daily water losses across multiple case study dams and evaluates the effectiveness of common mitigation strategies, including quantifying the evaporation reduction from continuous floating covers and fringing vegetation.\n\nWSD Surface Water Technical Report\nWhen on-farm sources are exhausted, relying on water carting from scheme water and other supplementary supplies is the single most costly way to source water. It is a poor and costly response to drought adaptation. This project looks at options to address this challenge by: 1) evaluating the performance of enhanced or engineered surface catchments that use PVC tarpaulins and other plastic surfaces (HDPE) to harvest water from low-intensity rainfall events, and 2) the utility of subsurface drainage systems to capture water from waterlogged soils and harvest and store it in dams for on-farm non-potable use."

    "text": "Depending on how you configure the catchment profile, there are various ways that you can model catchments and simulate runoff from them after precipitation events.\nFor each simulation, you can configure two catchments mix models used to generate runoff from catchments. For example, you could set catchment 1 to be a small roaded catchment using a runoff threshold-style catchment model and you could set catchment 2 to be a larger vegetated catchment where your catchment model accounts for evapotranspiration losses.\n\n\nRunoff threshold-style models daily runoff from the catchment if rainfall exceeded a runoff threshold, all rainfall above the threshold runs into the dam.\nTo use runoff threshold-style catchments you can set the depth to the confining layer to 0 (this effectively prevents the catchment from storing moisture) and set an appropriate runoff threshold. You can optionally set a runoff coefficient where a percentage of precipitation exceeding the runoff threshold actually runs off into the dam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModelling runoff from a plastic catchment\n\n\n\nYou would like to model runoff from a catchment that you have covered in plastic sheeting. You know the plastic covered catchment generates runoff for precipitation events greater than 1 mm and 80% of precipitation greater than 1 mm runs off into the dam.\nThis is how you would configure this catchment profile:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to simulate runoff from bare earth catchments that store soil moisture and retain memory of soil moisture levels. Here, the evaporating bare earth catchments are based on a model by Allen et al. (2005), which is a two-stage model.\nThe first stage of the model is when evaporation is energy limited and the soil provides enough moisture to meet evaporative demand. There is a constant amount evaporation between field capacity and a point where all readily available water has been evaporated.\nThe second stage of the model is soil limited, where soil hydraulic properties and conditions limit the amount of moisture that can be moved to the surface for evaporation. The rate of evaporation from the soil linearly decreases with soil moisture to a point where no more soil moisture can be evaporated (half the wilting point, following Allen et al. (2005)). You can set the depth and porosity of the soil to determine how much moisture the catchment can store.

    "text": "Depending on how you configure the catchment profile, there are various ways that you can model catchments and simulate runoff from them after precipitation events.\nFor each simulation, you can configure two catchments mix models used to generate runoff from catchments. For example, you could set catchment 1 to be a small roaded catchment using a runoff threshold-style catchment model and you could set catchment 2 to be a larger vegetated catchment where your catchment model accounts for evapotranspiration losses.\n\n\nRunoff threshold-style models daily runoff from the catchment if rainfall exceeded a runoff threshold, all rainfall above the threshold runs into the dam.\nTo use runoff threshold-style catchments you can set the depth to the confining layer to 0 (this effectively prevents the catchment from storing moisture) and set an appropriate runoff threshold. You can optionally set a runoff coefficient where a percentage of precipitation exceeding the runoff threshold actually runs off into the dam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModelling runoff from a plastic catchment\n\n\n\nYou would like to model runoff from a catchment that you have covered in plastic sheeting.

Here, the evaporating bare earth catchments are based on a model by Allen et al. (2005), which is a two-stage model.\nThe first stage of the model is when evaporation is energy limited and the soil provides enough moisture to meet evaporative demand. There is a constant amount evaporation between field capacity and a point where all readily available water has been evaporated.\nThe second stage of the model is soil limited, where soil hydraulic properties and conditions limit the amount of moisture that can be moved to the surface for evaporation. The rate of evaporation from the soil linearly decreases with soil moisture to a point where no more soil moisture can be evaporated (half the wilting point, following Allen et al. (2005)).
